/**
 * Signs Qobuz API requests. Qobuz validates `request_sig = md5(object+method
 * + params-in-fixed-order + request_ts + app_secret)`. The param order and
 * literal concatenation per endpoint were reverse-engineered from qbdlx's JS
 * and locked by [QbdlxSignerTest] against real HAR vectors. [clock] returns
 * epoch SECONDS (injectable so the vectors are reproducible).
 *
 * The `app_secret` is a PER-CALL argument, not constructor state: a Qobuz token
 * only returns full-quality FLAC when it is signed with the `app_secret` of the
 * app_id it was minted under. The pool spans more than one app_id (each with its
 * own secret) and a user-connected account carries its own pair, so the correct
 * secret is chosen per request by [QbdlxSigningResolver] — a single bundled
 * secret silently degrades mismatched tokens to 30-second previews.
