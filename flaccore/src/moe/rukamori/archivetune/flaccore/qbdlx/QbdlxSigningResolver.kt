/**
 * The (app_id, app_secret) pair a given token's requests must be signed with.
 *
 * Qobuz binds a `user_auth_token` to the app_id it was minted under: `getFileUrl`
 * only returns full FLAC when the request is signed with THAT app_id's secret.
 * Sign with the wrong pair and the same token silently yields a 30-second preview
 * (HTTP 200, `sample:true`) — indistinguishable from "track not available" unless
 * you know to look. So the pair travels with the token, not with the client.

/**
 * Resolves the [QbdlxSigning] pair to use for a token. Implemented by
 * [QbdlxCredentialStore], which knows each token's origin: the bundled/remote
 * pool tags every token with its app_id, and a user-connected account stores its
 * own pair. Unknown tokens fall back to the primary bundled pair.
 *
 * Narrow interface (not the whole store) so [QbdlxApiClient] depends only on the
 * one thing it needs and stays trivially fake-able in tests.
