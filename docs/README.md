## About YumaPlayer

YumaPlayer is a modular Android music player focused on maintainability, modularity, and a consistent user experience.

The project combines YouTube Music streaming, lossless FLAC streaming, local playback, synchronized lyrics, Spotify Canvas visualizers, Shazam track recognition, and multiple optional service integrations while keeping every subsystem isolated in dedicated modules.

Originally evolved from ArchiveTune (with core dependencies traced back to Metrolist and SimpMusic), YumaPlayer has developed into an independent project with its own architecture, design system, and engineering standards.

### Architecture Overview

The codebase is organized into independent modules with clearly defined responsibilities. Each module has a single responsibility and communicates through well-defined interfaces:

- **`:app`** — Entry point, application class, and DI composition root.
- **`:core` & `:data`** — Network clients (InnerTube API), local storage, and shared utilities.
- **`:feature:*`** — Standalone UI features and screen-level logic.
- **`:service:playback`** — Media3 ExoPlayer background playback infrastructure.
- **`:lyrics:*`** — Isolated lyrics providers (`lrclib`, `paxsenix`, `kugou`, `unison`, `youlyplus`).
- **`:spotifycore` & `:shazamkit`** — Dedicated third-party metadata and recognition integrations.

## Documentation Structure

Documentation is organized into three main areas:

### 1. 🏛️ [Architecture](./architecture/)
System design, module boundaries, dependencies, and architectural decision records.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — High-level Clean Architecture rules and data flow.
- **MODULES.md** — Comprehensive catalog of all project modules and dependency matrix.
- **DECISIONS.md** — Architectural Decision Records (ADRs: M3 Expressive, HCT, Media3, UDF).

### 2. 🛠️ [Development](./development/)
Development rules, standards, step-by-step guides, and agent guidelines.
- **YUMA_RULES.md** — Non-negotiable project constitution and strict constraints.
- **CODING_STANDARD.md** — Code style, ViewModel conventions, Mappers, and Coroutine safety.
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** — Step-by-step recipes (adding screens, lyrics providers, new modules).

### 3. 🎨 [Design](./design/)
UI design system, tokens, and component guidelines.
- **YDS.md** — Yuma Design System 1.0 specification (tokens, HCT color engine, elevation, motion).
- **COMPONENT_GUIDE.md** — Guidelines for creating stateless Yuma UI Kit components.

## Documentation Principles

- **Single Responsibility:** Each document addresses a specific architectural, design, or workflow domain.
- **Long-term Conventions:** Documentation describes long-term project standards rather than temporary implementation details.
- **Synchronization:** Documentation should reflect the current architecture and implementation. Whenever architectural decisions change, the relevant documentation should be updated accordingly.

---

## Documentation Maintenance

Documentation is considered part of the source code.

Any architectural, UI, or workflow change must update the relevant documentation within the same pull request.
